What I want to make ready until 18.01.2020: 
#clean up main.py - is there a better way then enclosure?
#line insertion
#template splitting
#updating
#activate programm via console


# fix popmenu bugg: clicking next to split butto also splits

Features that could be added:
#plan rediscovers its structure in text
#save plan structure into plan.txt in order to reload it
#add gui widgets like file-name, director(showing current file directory)
#check templates for guidelines
#save and write to directory by console demand path
#addhotkeys for everything
#automatic updating

# mache schrift der Buttons in Structure dynamischer

Test:
Is it enough to write root.dismiss in popmenu.kv


#DONE:
# 100 % synchronize Plan and Structure in 
# popup window close on delete and split
#refactor
# make logic folders
#create new files
#create new templates
#load old files
