What I want to make ready until 18.01.2020: 

#template splitting on update
#activate programm via console

#fix create plan bugg
#refacor plan update & co. 
#make it easier for the programm to read the lines
#make centralize rules fdor reading files
#restructure test_plan test_update vs test_template

# fix popmenu bugg: clicking next to split butto also splits

Features that could be added:
#plan rediscovers its structure in text
#save plan structure into plan.txt in order to reload it
#add gui widgets like file-name, director(showing current file directory)
#check templates for guidelines
#save and write to directory by console demand path
#addhotkeys for everything
#automatic updating
# mache schrift der Buttons in Structure dynamischer

Test:
Is it enough to write root.dismiss in popmenu.kv


#DONE:
#add equals method to plan & co
#change main.py - do not use pop ups!
# 100 % synchronize Plan and Structure in 
# popup window close on delete and split
#refactor
# make logic folders
#create new files
